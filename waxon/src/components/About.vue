              My name is Sebastian. I am a Machine Learning Engineer, and I'm
              very passionate and dedicated to my work.

              With 1+ years experience as a professional, I have acquired the
              skills and knowledge necessary to make your project a success. I
              enjoy every step of the design process, from discussion and
              collaboration. I have interned in the Muckli lab in Glasgow,
              Scottland, and the lab of Prof. Stuerzlinger at SFU in Vancouver,
              Canada.
